A current Work In Progress. 

What it is: 
  - A private tutoring website for a client meaning to deploy this website to attract new customers and develop his brand.

  Sass
    - Sass will be implemented to better organise the CSS code through nesting and varibales for the webpages colour pallete
  Responsive Design
    - This website will feature a fully realised design for mobile users seeing as a majority of traffic in 2021 is now mobile
      users.
  Javascript/Jquery
    - Javasccript will be implemented for elements such as the hamburger menu within the mobile design implementation.
      > This menu will have to disable itself when on bigger screens e.g (tablet, laptop, desktop)
    - Animations will be used to smoothly load elements when the user scolls down the webpage and upon entering the site.
    - Other elements may be added such as a popup form upon clicking a button but is not guaranteed/fully realised.
